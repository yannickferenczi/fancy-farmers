                <p>Welcome to our Easter Monday event organized by our bio farm! We are excited to offer a unique and educational experience for
                    our guests.
                </p>
                <p>First, we will be hosting a honey collection course where a limited number of participants can learn the art of collecting honey from
                    our farm's hives. The course will be led by our experienced beekeeper who will teach you about the bees' life cycle, the importance
                    of bees in our ecosystem, and the process of honey harvesting. This hands-on experience will allow you to collect your own jar of
                    honey to take home with you. The ticket for the course costs 25€ and includes access to the bonfire.
                </p>
                <p>After the course, we invite everyone to join us for a bonfire and barbecue. This is open to all guests, regardless of whether they
                    participated in the honey collection course or not. The bonfire ticket alone costs 15€ and include access to the bonfire and live
                    music, 3 pieces of meat, all you can eat vegies, bread and drinks.
                </p>
                <p>Our farm's own organic produce will be used for the barbecue, including grilled vegetables and our own farm-raised meats. We will
                    also have live music, outdoor games, and a marshmallow roasting station.
                </p>
                <p>Please note that tickets for the honey collection course are limited, so book early to secure your spot. We can't wait to share this
                    special Easter Monday with you and your loved ones! <a class="internal-link" href="contact.html" aria-label="Contact us">Book here!</a>

                    participated in the bread baking course or not. We will provide the dough and toppings, and you can create your own unique pizza.
                    We will then bake the pizzas in our wood-fired oven for a delicious and authentic experience. The bonfire ticket alone costs 15€.
                </p>
                <p>Our farm's own organic produce will be used for the pizza toppings, including fresh tomatoes, herbs, and vegetables. We will also
