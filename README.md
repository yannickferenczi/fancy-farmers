<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<strong>Design orientation</strong>

The Website has been designed to communicate the feeling of nature and peace while the first goal is to show the user the proximity of the farm and how easy it is to have fresh and healthy products every week.

<strong>Colours</strong>

Regarding the colours, a darkgreen and a violet have been used for the logo to associate the nature with the quality. In fact, the green brings Harmony, refreshment, environmental awareness and peace and the violet brings Spiritual awareness, luxury, authenticity and quality.
Those two colours, combined with the yellow create a triadic colour, in which the yellow brings the energy.

As they are all three strong colours, the green and the violet have only been used with little touch to always refer to the logo, while the intensity of the yellow, used as a background color with an image, has been reduce with the transparency property to keep the overall balance a nice harmony.

Finally, a cover picture with a big blue sky has been used on the landing page to place the user into a calm and seren mood.

Because those colours are very strong and have a strong contrast together some black and white have been used to separate those colours and therefore use the full power of their association.

<strong>Fonts</strong>

Oleo Script Swash Caps has been used for the logo to communicate our elegance and break down some stereotypes associated to farmers. It has also been used for the headings to keep a certain consistency through the website. Cursive has been use as a fallback.

For the rest of the content, the more readable Open Sans has been used with a sans-serif as fallback. Open Sans has been used because it was a good recommendation to associate it to the Oleo Script Swash Caps font.

<strong>Structure</strong>

A common structure is used over all pages and contains a Header, with the logo and the menu, and a Footer, with the copyright and the social media links.
The website has 5 pages accessible from the menu:

<strong>Validator Testing for syntaxe errors</strong>

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
The file base.css has been imported in all of the following tested css file. The result of the W3C CSS Validator for that file is shown below: <br> <img src="assets\images\w3c-css-validator-base.png">

At last, all html and css file have returned 'no errors or warnings to show'. But it has not shown directly that result.
<br><br>
I wanted to add a hamburger menu to the navigation of the website without knowing that it was actually more a JavaScript thing.
But because I did not want to give up on that feature, I have managed to find a way to make it work with css only. Nevertheless, nesting a label tag inside a list element created an error when checking the HTML code. To fix that issue, I simply replaced the ul and li elements with some div elements keeping the same parent-children relationship.
<br><br>
Another error I encountered has been related to the iframe element I inserted from google maps on the landing page. I wanted the map to be responsive and therefore replaced the value of attributes height and width with some percentages. This practice generated an error on the validator. To fix it I just put back some digits only. The map was not responsive anymore but it did not seem to be a problem. If it would be, an easy way to fix it might be to use a few iframes with different dimensions and display them regarding the size of the screen.
<br><br>
I also had some issue while using the section element. It did not generate errors but some warnings. The origin of that issue was that the section elements should only be used with headings nested inside them. It was not always my case and when it was, the headings were not direct children but nested inside a div element, itself nested inside the section elements. To get rid of those warnings, I just replaced the section elements with some div elements.

<strong>Further testing for responsiveness and cross-browsers compatibility</strong>
<ul>
    <li>The Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari browsers.</li>
    <li>The Website was viewed on a smartphone Android, iPhone, tablet Android, Lenovo desktop, MacBook.</li>
    <li>All links have been tested and work perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugs">Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For some reasons, the pictures on the products and on the events pages have a small gap at the bottom which is not intended. I did not find how to fix it.</li>
    <li>On the form, the submit and reset input keep their css properties with the hover values while using a touch screens. I think a small screens first approach while coding the css file would be the best way to fix this issue.</li>
