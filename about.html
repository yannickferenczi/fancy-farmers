        <div class="div-left">
            <h3>Who we are <i class="fa-solid fa-people-roof"></i></h3>
            <p>Welcome to our family-owned <strong>bio farm</strong>! We are a unique farm in that
                we have a deep respect for our land and the environment, and as such,
                we do not allow vehicles on our fields. Our farm has been in operation
                since 1850, and we are proud to say that we are now in our 5th
                generation of family ownership and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>Our farm is located in a picturesque countryside, surrounded by rolling
                hills and lush green fields. We specialize in producing <strong>organic and
                    sustainable crops</strong>, and our commitment to responsible farming practices
                is evident in everything we do.
            </p>
            <p>At our farm, we believe in the importance of preserving our land for
                future generations. That's why we have adopted a number of eco-friendly
                practices, including crop rotation, composting, and natural pest control
                methods. Our commitment to sustainability doesn't stop there - we also
                use renewable energy sources and strive to minimize waste wherever
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>We take pride in our farm-to-table approach, and we love sharing our
                produce with our community. Whether you're looking for <strong>fresh, organic
                    vegetables</strong>, or <strong>pasture-raised chicken eggs</strong>, we have something for
                everyone. And if you're interested in learning more about our farming
                practices, we offer <a class="internal-link" href="events.html" aria-label="Check our events">events</a> throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p>We invite you to come visit us and see for yourself what makes our farm
                so special. From our family to yours, we look forward to welcoming you to
                our farm!

            <h3>Bio and organic certifications <i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i></h3>
            <p>At our family-owned <strong>bio farm</strong>, we are proud to have both <strong>bio
                certifications</strong> and <strong>organic certifications</strong>, which sets us apart from many
                other farms. These certifications are a testament to our commitment to
                sustainable and responsible farming practices.
            </p>
            <p>Our <strong>bio certification</strong> means that we meet strict European Union
                standards for organic agriculture, including the use of natural fertilizers,
                crop rotation, and natural pest control methods. We are committed to
                using sustainable farming methods that preserve the health of our soil,
                protect our local ecosystem, and promote biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p>Our <strong>organic certification</strong> is another mark of our commitment to
                producing high-quality, <strong>healthy food</strong>. We do not use synthetic fertilizers,
                pesticides, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on our crops or
                animals. Instead, we rely on natural methods to maintain healthy soil and
                control pests.
            </p>
            <p>We take pride in our certifications, which demonstrate our dedication to
                sustainable farming practices and the production of healthy, <strong>organic
                    food</strong>. Our customers can trust that when they purchase products from
                our farm, they are getting the highest quality farming product.                
            </p>
            <p>Our certifications are not just a label - they are a way of life at our farm.
                We believe that by working in harmony with nature, we can produce food
                that is both delicious and nutritious, while also promoting the health of
                our environment and our local community.
                Come visit us and see for yourself why our bio and organic certifications
                are so special!
